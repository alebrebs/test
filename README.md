Hello does this worl

vDo you think that the complexity of the project environment is typical of a software development group, or is it less or more complex?
 

I feel that the level of complexity seen by the TSSG in constantly finding and reworking the open-source free software to work with one another seems a bit more complex then say a waterfall style development cycle. With this development cycle, it seems the work never ends and new software programs get incorporated and processed as time goes on, sounding like a very complex and hectic version of iterative SDLC. The environment seems to get more complex than the development group as a result.

 

 

What’s a specific problem that the group ran into that required workarounds?
 The software used for testing is Selenium. Selenium has a problem dealing with Window-specific pop-up dialogues. To workaround this, Selenium provides a feature to handle browser pop-ups (via getWindowHandles and switchTo. window) , but this framework does not work for non-browser components. To work around this,  they use another open-source tool know as iMacros to deal with  the interaction with the external dialogue , calling it from Selenium. Basically, in this example, if it doesn't work with one software tool set, find another open-source software and try to merge/create an interaction between the two (in this case Selenium and iMacros).

 

 

Why do you think that such an emphasis was placed on the requirements tracking toolset?
 

The most important part of a program is that it meets all desired requirements. Having a toolkit (tool or set of tools) that allows us to check code, run tests and test/see whether requirements are fulfilled and functional would be extremely helpful, allowing for rapid testing, reprogramming and re-testing to occur. Because the requirements of a program are the most important part, there would be an emphasis on tracking toolkit for them.

 

Describe how you would feel working in this development group, in terms of your everyday work load.
 

Based on what I read, I feel everyday would non-stop work, whether its constantly testing, fixing and testing; finding new free open-source software to incorporate, fixing potential problems from third party open source software such as outdated plugins. It feels like the work will never end, and that there is no real definitive end goal for this project.

 

 

Do you think that the TSSG project environment is sustainable, or will it fall in under the weight of maintaining the tool set?
 

The bigger the tool set, the more time and resources will be required to maintain it. Unless there is unlimited funding, research funds/grants, investors or profits made from the TSSG project, I feel the project will eventually fall.

 

What is the most obvious problem that TSSG will face in the next two to three years with their solution?
a). The software they are using stop being free, which ruins their zero-cost solution.

b). Their solution in having such a massive tool that keeps growing will need constant updates and maintenance, which could prove costly.

c). In the conclusion, it says that they don’t receive funding and have to compete nationally and internationally, which means if the TSSG can’t maintain their product, they will fall to the competition.

d). The solution could get too big to sustain and maintain.

e). Maybe software gets outdated and needs to be replaced
